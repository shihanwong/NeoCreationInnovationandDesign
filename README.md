# The Detector 2.0 (Change Later)

# NeoCreation Innovation and Design (NCID)
Hi, we are Team NeoCreation Innovation and Design or NCID for short. Our team name represent qualities needed to stay relevant in the highly technological and digitalise future - Creativity, Innovation and Design. We are a 3 membered team consisting of university students to be. Our team members are as follows: Gabriel, Ryan and Shi Han. Allow us to share with you our project to tackle SCDF X IBM Lifesavers' Innovation Challenge: Call for Code 2020

## The question
**Emergency Medical Services** 
> SCDF works closely with Community First Responders (CFRs) to provide timely relief and response to emergency situations. With the increasingly aging population and a growing segment of vulnerable populations in mind (e.g. increasing trend of elderly with no next of kin), how might we leverage analytics for better sense-making to be alerted at the onset of incidents which require emergency response (e.g. cardiac arrests, falls, unattended cooking fires etc.) and mobilise CFRs for effective early intervention especially to the vulnerable populations?

### Our analysis of the question
This question requires us to focus on three key aspects:
 1. Solution has to take into account the elderly and the vulnerable. In this case, they will be our target audience
 2. Solution has to utilise analytic technology to be able to more aware of incidents that happen, and to allow the authorities to be alerted to such incidents early should there be a need to escalate the problem
 3. Solution should aim to be able to mobolise CFRs quickly to provide quick intervention to our target audience

As such, our team have devised an mobile application to be able to achieve the following aims. Find out more below

## Short description of our project

### What's the problem?
From our research, we found that *67.9%* of accidents happened when elderly are at home. Most of the injuries occur at home and falling is the commonest cause. Furthermore, the proportion of older adults living alone has been increasing since 2000. Between 2000 and 2015, the percentage of Singaporeans 65 years and older living alone grew from *6.6% to 8.9 %*. *83000* elderly will be living alone by 2030. The number of calls involving the elderly (aged 65 and above) remained the highest among all age categories, at *43.8%*. This highlights the pressing need to have a system to be able to monitor the elderly and vulnerable through the use of technology to be able to alert their family members or authorities should there be an emergency and to mobilise CFRs in a timely and effective manner for quick intervention.

### How can technology help?
Smart technolgy is an integral part of our everyday lives. From our smartphones to our televisions, they are equipped with a suite of sensors able to detect and monitor the surrounding. These pieces of information can be pieced together to create a picture that may be able to narrate the personal lives of users

### The idea
Humans are highly habitual in nature. Smart technology is able to be used to monitor the elderly and vulnerable. Using the suite of sensors (e.g. light, sound, cameras, etc) from various devices located around the house, it is able to be able to create an ecosystem to detect the behaviour and habits of our target audience. 

Using smart analytics, we are able to harness the information to derive models to predict the user's schedule. Subsequently, this can be used to detect anomalities in the day to day life of the users, which could signify the user getting into an incident. This could then be used to trigger an alert to family members or the authorities. With that, CFRs can be mobilised quickly for quick intervention.
