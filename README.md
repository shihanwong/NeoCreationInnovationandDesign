# The Detector 2.0 (Change Later)

# NeoCreation Innovation and Design (NCID)
Hi, we are Team NeoCreation Innovation and Design or NCID for short. Our team name represent qualities needed to stay relevant in the highly technological and digitalise future - Creativity, Innovation and Design. We are a 3 membered team consisting of university students to be. Our team members are as follows: Gabriel, Ryan and Shi Han. Allow us to share with you our project to tackle SCDF X IBM Lifesavers' Innovation Challenge: Call for Code 2020

## The question
**Emergency Medical Services** 
> SCDF works closely with Community First Responders (CFRs) to provide timely relief and response to emergency situations. With the increasingly aging population and a growing segment of vulnerable populations in mind (e.g. increasing trend of elderly with no next of kin), how might we leverage analytics for better sense-making to be alerted at the onset of incidents which require emergency response (e.g. cardiac arrests, falls, unattended cooking fires etc.) and mobilise CFRs for effective early intervention especially to the vulnerable populations?

### Our analysis of the question
This question requires us to focus on three key aspects:
 1. Solution has to take into account the elderly and the vulnerable. In this case, they will be our target audience
 2. Solution has to utilise analytic technology to be able to more aware of incidents that happen, and to allow the authorities to be alerted to such incidents early should there be a need to escalate the problem
 3. Solution should aim to be able to mobolise CFRs quickly to provide quick intervention to our target audience

As such, our team have devised an mobile application to be able to achieve the following aims. Find out more below

## Short description of our project

### What's the problem?
**Quote statistics here** From our research, we found that 67.9% of accidents happened to elderly at home. Most of the injuries occur at home and falling is the commonest cause. Many of the injuries are potentially preventable with the development of our App.
